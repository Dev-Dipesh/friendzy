		<p>We take the best social shopping experience and make it local. At Clamour, we connect with Facebook to create and manage virtual, velvet rope neighborhoods for you to buy/sell, laugh and play with people you can trust - all right where you live. Imagine getting back nearly 50% of what you paid for great items you loved having, but no longer need.  How about every time you want to make a purchase, you can buy whatever makes you happy, in great condition, for at least half-off retail ….and all right where you live! No need to box or ship a thing and you finally won’t be afraid of who you’re meeting - you might even make a new friend. That’s Clamour! We work to eliminate all fraud, fear and frustration and replace it with friends, fun, fantastic goods and found money.</p>

		<p>Clamour creates marketplaces where people can buy things they really want and sell things they no longer need. Items may range from furniture, electronics and kids items, to clothes, purses and jewelry. A seller posts an item using the Clamour window in Facebook, which is then also posted simultaneously on the Clamour newsfeed. Members of the Clamour group can scroll through their newsfeed for items of interest, comment, and see what their friends and neighbors are saying and selling. To buy something, a user clicks the picture of the item on Facebook, or the “reserve” button on Clamour. After that, Clamour sends an email placing the buyer and seller in direct contact to arrange for a meet and greet and to see the product prior to the final transaction. Once the buyer verifies the item in person, an online, secure payment takes place on the spot and the buyer leaves with the item. Our buyers and sellers are meeting new friends and transacting with people they know and love. And of course - doing good for our communities and our planet. Oh yes, and it’s fun!</p>
